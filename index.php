            <h3>Vegetables</h3>
            <p>
            
                Vegetables are an essential part of our daily diet and are cultivated primarily for their edible parts,
                which include roots, stems, leaves, and flowers. They provide essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals,
                fiber, and antioxidants, making them crucial for a healthy and balanced diet. Vegetables are harvested while
                they are still immature and have a relatively short shelf life. From leafy greens like spinach and lettuce
                to root vegetables like carrots and potatoes, vegetables are versatile and can be consumed fresh, cooked, 
                or preserved for later use.<br>
                <b>Examples:</b>
                Carrots, Lettuce, Tomatoes, Spinach, Cucumbers, Potatoes, Peppers, and more.

            <h3>Fruits</h3>
            <p>Fruits are the mature, edible reproductive bodies of plants that contain seeds. They are typically sweet or
               sour in taste and are packed with essential vitamins, minerals, fiber, and antioxidants. Fruits are generally 
               harvested when they reach maturity, and their consumption has both nutritional and cultural significance across
               the globe. Whether eaten fresh, juiced, or used in cooking, fruits are a key component of a healthy diet. They
               are enjoyed in a variety of ways and are a staple in many culinary traditions worldwide.

            <br><b>Examples:</b>Apples, Bananas, Oranges, Mangoes, Grapes, Strawberries, and more.</p>

            <h3>Cereals</h3>
            <p>
                Cereals are edible seeds harvested from various grass species, and they are a major source of carbohydrates 
                and essential nutrients such as fiber and protein. These staple crops are foundational to global food security 
                and are used in a wide variety of food products, from breads and pastas to breakfast cereals and snacks. Cereals
                 are typically grown for their high starch content and are often processed into flour or grains. These crops can
                  also serve as animal feed and are central to many agricultural economies.<br>

                <b>Examples:</b><br>
                Wheat, Rice, Corn, Barley, Oats, Sorghum, and more.

            <h3>Specialty Crops</h3>
            <p>Specialty crops are a diverse group of agricultural products that are not classified as vegetables, 
                fruits, or cereals but are still vital for food, industrial, medicinal, and aesthetic uses. This category 
                includes a wide range of crops such as legumes, tubers, oilseeds, medicinal plants, and even ornamental plants.
                 These crops offer unique benefits, whether for their nutritional value, oil content, medicinal properties, or 
                 use in fibers and textiles. Specialty crops are essential for diversifying agricultural production and enhancing
                  sustainability.<br>

                <b>Examples:</b>
                Legumes (Beans, Lentils), Tubers (Cassava), Oilseeds (Sunflower, Canola), Spices (Ginger, Garlic), Medicinal plants (Lavender, Ginseng), and more.</p>
